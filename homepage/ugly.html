                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>
                        My name is Eric Brisson and I am from Edmonton, Alberta. I'm currently in my fourth year of
                        studying
                        Computing Science at the University of Alberta,
                        where I also spent several years working as a teaching assistant, and in my last year, worked to
                        help
                        create
                        a new course now being offered in the Department of
                        Computing Science. In addition, I work as a junior software developer at a local startup called
                        Cash
                        2
                        Crypto, and on the side, as a part-time barista at Starbucks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outside of work and school, I enjoy playing Animal Crossing, running, and listening to lofi
                        music. I
                        am
                        motivated by a desire to continually improve my skills,
                        and I am passionate about helping others, working in tech, and winding down at the end of the
                        day.
                        My
                        personal and professional goal is to establish a well-rounded skillset
                        and knowledge base on various aspects of computing and tech, setting myself up for success in
                        life.
